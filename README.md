# Llama_Index_basics
The general usage pattern of LlamaIndex is as follows:

1. Load in documents (either manually, or through a data loader)

2. Parse the Documents into Nodes

3. Construct Index (from Nodes or Documents)

4. [Optional, Advanced] Building indices on top of other indices

5. Query the index
